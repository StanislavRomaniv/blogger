Pet-project. Used TypeScript and Next.js and its features like: API Routes, pre-rendering etc.

MongoDB is used for the database.

For form validation and submission is used library Formik.

The app has auhentication including Google, Github, Facebook and credentials auth also.

Implemented functionality like: comments for the single blog, likes for each blog. For the future planned to add email verification and creating own blogs by users.

Would be appreciatory for any feedback and advices! You`re welcome!
